3. Handle high scalability demands in communication between server and client.
4. How did you handle versioning of your RESTful APIs to ensure backward compatibility while introducing new features? What strategies did you use to manage API changes without disrupting your existing client?
5. Could you describe a project where you had to break down monolithic application into micro services? What were the key challenges you faced and how did you address them?
6. Where did you apply Object Oriented Programming features in your project?
7. To handle real-time streaming data with Java, consider how you would design the system for scalability and fault tolerance. Use your judgment to give your best shot.
